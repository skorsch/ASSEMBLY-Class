# ASSEMBLY-Class
Projects I completed for a 200-level computer architecture class. We used MIPS32 in MARS to practice coding in assembly.

Final course grade: 83%

Course description:
This course approaches the topics related to computer organization and architecture in two ways: the "what", and the "how".
This leads to an introductory understanding of:

the design of processors; the structure and operation of memory and virtual memory, cache, storage; pipelining; system integration; and peripherals.
